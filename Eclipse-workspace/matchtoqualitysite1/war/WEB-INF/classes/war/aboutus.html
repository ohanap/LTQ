                            	<p>Founded in 2009, MatchToQuality creates adaptive content that engages students and bolsters achievement. LearnToQuality Financial Risk module was conceived by 3 financial professionals with more than 50 years of combined experience. Our extensive theoretical and empirical knowledge in Financial Risk combined with worldwide renown experts material is the basis for the content presented in its simplest form for learners of any background. After the 2008 crisis, we were tasked to produce a full fledged Financial Risk curriculum for junior and experienced risk analysts. We couldn&#39;t find any curriculum that was complete, engaging and could be applied directly to the risk function. After a year of intense work producing such a curriculum on our own, LearnToQuality was born!</p>
